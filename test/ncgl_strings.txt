The desert landscape was lush with saguaros and other species of cactus, all swollen from the winter's rains.
In this area, lovely ferns and wildflowers dot the landscape, and small meadows are visible every so often along the creek.
This part of the trail is very easy going, as it winds through cool aspen forests along the boundary line of the Kachina Wilderness Area.
Hiking up the steep slopes of Lennox Crater Taking with us one bottle of water each, John and Mary and I began the short but very steep hike up to Lennox Crater.
After checking the topographical and Forest Service maps, John came up with the perfect solution: we could camp near the line shack!
We then continued north on SR 87, past Pine and Strawberry, to the Mogollon Rim.
The best one we found were on a high bench on the left bank of the river approximately 4 miles from the springs.
From there, it meandered through the bright green desert foliage, all the way to the state park boundary.
From the trailhead, cross the boulder-filled Dry Creek and look for the metal sign post that says Secret Canyon and the trail register.
It is located near Playa Elegante, across the street from Manny's Beach Club, which used to be one of our favorite lunch spots - that is, before the fence went up - and it is a good place to get a good American breakfast with a little Mexican appeal.
Equipped with our Apache-Sitgreaves Forest Service map, the five of us left the cabin to try to find the General Crook Trail.
The trail ends at a trail junction, where several different trails branch off, one of which continues all the way to the top of Mount Peeley.
The plan for the day was to hike the Houston Brothers Trail #18, which begins at the Fred Haught Trailhead, near the junction of Forest Roads 95 and 139A. The Houston Brothers Trail - along with the Barbershop Trail, the U-Bar Trail - are all part of the Cabin Loop Trail System, in which hikers can find three old forest cabins that were once used by the forest service to house rangers during periods of high fire danger.
According to John, there weren't really any other places to camp along the U-Bar Trail, not even in Barbershop Canyon, which meant that cutting our trip short was not an option.
The first hundred feet is a steep climb up to the ridgeline; then, as the trail enters into the Pusch Ridge Wilderness Area, it follows the contour and meanders through ponderosa pines and oak and sycamore trees.
A half mile from the first gate, the trail ends in a large parking area that is the west trailhead (elevation 6050) for this trail and the Little Yeager Canyon Trail #533.
Water from snowcaps on top of the Continental Divide was pouring down crevices on the mountains, onto the highway and beyond, creating waterfalls of every size: from big, gushing waterfalls and light showers (like the Weeping Wall), to tiny trickles.
miles from the picnic area the Blacketts Ridge Trail heads to the east.
After leaving the corral, the trail crosses the creek just before the junction of Reavis Canyon and Whitford Canyon.
After a quarter of a mile, we reached the trail junction with the Second Water Trail #236; this trail would take us on a very gentle climb up to Garden Valley, located about 1.5 miles from the trailhead.
Nearby, a 20-foot waterfall cascades down.
when we left the house and headed north on I-17, towards Flagstaff.
On top of this hill, he discovered an arch, as well as several small windows in the rocks.
At this point the trail crosses over to the west side of the creek.
YS Falls is another popular tourist destination, situated on the YS Estate, which was originally a cane farm, a factory, and a logwood farm.
As we left the Lower Falls, the trail began to climb towards the Upper Falls, which were about 0.8 miles away.
After the switchbacks end, the trail travels through a flat forested grove.
On the other side of the creek, the trail continued on, along a ridgeline above the creek.
The Sno-Coach followed a graded road on the ice to a large area that was surrounded by blue safety cones.
That was when we found treasure along the trail: a small cave, butterflies, and even a pink tree!
After a quarter of a mile, Trail #47 branches off to the left.
The Weatherford trail is an old road that was built in the 1920's to ferry cars to the upper part of the San Francisco Peaks.
That caused us to lose the trail several times, so we would have to stop and look around for the trail markers in Autumn leaves along the West Webber Trail #228 order to find the path again.
Then, at the very end of the trail, we found, as John had promised, a well-manicured trailhead: a large parking area, surrounded by a low fence and marked with trail signs.
After cleaning up camp, the four of us jumped into the van, and we drove down the Control Road to Highway 87 then up to Clint's Well to buy some snacks for the road.
Though it was a good guess, he was proven wrong when we came to the last slot canyon: the one that was only one meter wide and full of water!
To the left, Stoneman Lake Road continues on towards the small mountain lake and eventually intersects with Forest Highway 3 (Lake Mary Road).
From the trailhead the trail head east between two small hills.
What we learned is, to get to Haleakala National Park from Lahaina, take Highway 30 to Maalaea, then merge onto Highway 380, towards Kahului.
The Kachina Trail ends at the Weatherford trail after 6 miles (elevation 8788).
Established in 1670 as 'Charles Town' (named for Charles II of England), the settlement became a bustling port for the Atlantic trade routes.
From there, we continued east on I-10 towards the town on San Simon, which, as Jackie had indicated in her letter, was our last chance to fill up the Jeep with gas, as there wasn't another gas station around for many, many miles.
We emerged from the forest of aspens into an open area, with dried grass and sparse pine trees.
The trail description that John read stated that the trail would end up in a meadow, just within the boundaries of the Kachina Wilderness Area.
Continue on Catalina Highway until you reach the town of Summerhaven, at mile marker twenty-five.
But first, we had one more place to see in Moab, Utah: Arches National Park, located only a few miles north of Moab, along US Highway 191.
For the first half mile the trail heads southeast until it reaches the wilderness boundary (.
About two miles into the trail, we found it: a huge, flat boulder in the middle of Oak Creek - a picture perfect spot for a romantic picnic.
Three little caves in Paria Canyon Around the second mile, we came to a series of little caves, some of which were just big enough for one person, others for two people.
From the parking area, the trail stars across the road.
That trail was the Sinkhole Trail #503, a half-mile long trail that, as the name suggests, leads to a sinkhole.
Turn right onto Highway 288 and drive north for approximately 19.7 miles to the old Sierra Ancha Experiment Station Headquarters.
You will see a blaze on a tree in this grove and will be able to see where the trail heads off back into the forest.
Upon our arrival, John and I geared up and hit the trail, which begins on an old jeep road that descends all the way to Fossil Springs the wilderness area, at which time the trail narrows as it approaches the springs.
The actual summit of Mount Peeley was still five hundred feet away and another hundred foot climb up the rocky slopes of the mountain.
Once we crested the second summit, we followed the trail down the ridgeline, just below the Brown Mountain summit.
One particular wilderness area that had always intrigued John was the White Canyon Wilderness Area, located about ten miles south of Superior, near State Route 77.
The trail soon curved around the mountain, putting us at the bottom of that long, steep climb to the saddle.
As we climbed the ridgeline, we came across several young people wearing orange jumpsuits with Coconino Forest Service badges; they were performing trail maintenance.
According to the trail descriptions that we had read, we would not actually summit Brown Mountain (the third summit), but we would crest the first two.
This would be our first time on this trail since the Cave Creek Complex Fire had torn through that area last summer, so we hoped that we would be able to find a campsite within the first three miles of the trail and that the water in the creek was still relatively clean.
After successfully crossing the creek, we continued to follow the trail for another mile, at which time the path began to lead away from the creek.
The trail begins at the trail registry, just beyond the Hell's Canyon wilderness signs.
We drove two miles back up the highway to that first road, turned onto it, and learned that it was indeed the road to the Mail Trail Trailhead.
He climbed up to the top of the hill next to our campsite and continued to go south until he found an old jeep road that he described as a 'grass highway'.
There, the two-lane highway entered into a forest of pinion and juniper trees as it took us closer and closer to the national monument.
When full, the flood basin below the dam could be the largest lake in Arizona, passing the capacity of Lake Roosevelt, but that has never been the case.
We considered several options - FR 147 from Highway 87 to Potato Lake, Buffalo Park in Flagstaff, the Payson Area Trail System (PATS) - until John found an actual mountain biking trail that we had to try: the Willow Springs Bike Loop Trail #535.
Hiking the Margie's Cover Trail The trail did not stay in the wash for very long; it soon left the wash again and headed up and over some small hills.
Between Reavis Saddle and Reavis Ranch, the trail drops a mere four hundred feet over three miles, making it a very gentle downhill hike.
Gardner Canyon Road took us to FR 163, where we found the parking area for Kentucky Camp.
After stopping in Camp Verde to use the facilities, we continued east on SR 260 for about 25 miles, looking for Forest Road 9247B...
At the end of FR 642, we came to the trailhead, where there was a large parking area surrounded by boulders and a kiosk with trail information.
